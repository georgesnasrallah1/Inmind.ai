### Final Project Summary

The final project is organized into three key components: object detection utilizing YOLO, multiclass semantic segmentation implemented with DeepLabV3+, and an inference API developed using FastAPI.

#### Note :
A critical factor in achieving good results in this project was selecting the appropriate model for the task. It was essential to strike a balance between the model's complexity, its accuracy, and the size of the dataset. For instance, using a highly complex model on a small dataset of just 1,000 images would likely lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Therefore, the model must be appropriately scaled to match the task's complexity and the available data.
